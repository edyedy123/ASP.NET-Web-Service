# ASP.NET-Web-Service

This is a web service for an online music shop.  In this assignment I used a template provided by my professor. The template had lots of missing core functionality. I added the GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE functionality. My code, separated from the template can be found in the MyCode folder.

## What I learned

- I learned a lot about ASP.NET functionality and web services. 
- I got to see how to create a secure web service using ASP.NET
- Gained experience in C# and troubleshooting
